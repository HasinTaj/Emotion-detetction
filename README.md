# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using deep learning. The goal is to classify audio speech signals into various emotional categories such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **neutral**, etc.

---

## 📌 Features

- Classifies emotions from audio speech clips.
- Preprocessing includes feature extraction (MFCC, Chroma, etc.).
- Uses deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, or Transformer-based models.
- Evaluated on standard emotion datasets (e.g., RAVDESS, EmoDB).
- Real-time or batch audio inference supported.

## 📁 Dataset

We use publicly available datasets such as:

- [RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976)
- [EmoDB (Berlin Emotional Speech Database)](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasEmo.html)
